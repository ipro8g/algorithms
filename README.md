Im going to offer my personal solutions for diverse computer science problems, of course these are not the best way to solve it, this is about experimental models.

In my personal opinion a scientist must try to develop their own methods and try to reach their maximum efficiency as posible, in that way develop their own methodology to solve complex situations.
